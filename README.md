# ShatteredGuardian
ShatteredGuardian is a repository dedicated to collecting information about the evasion of GG.

# RollApp
If not blocked, RollApp is a great resource for evasion. It can be used to spawn offshore browsers and Linux terminals from a local Chromebook. There are several Python IDEs free to use on RollApp, which can be used to run the python scripts provided in this repository.
